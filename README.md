## How to Run
The program requires Java 1.6 JRE or above to run.
It accepts two command line arguments, filename and generations
If no generations argument is provided it only prints out the first and second generations

usage: `java GameMain <board file> <# of generations>`

ex: `java GameMain testboard.txt 300`
